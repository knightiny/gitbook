# Capture The Flag

Your main goal is to capture as many flags as possible to win and gain control of the kingdom and plasmid production. \
There are five flags in total; the flag gives more points in the 4th corner and the middle.

First, you will be at the base and, together with your team, determine the goal of the capture along the way; you will encounter other players and collect resources.

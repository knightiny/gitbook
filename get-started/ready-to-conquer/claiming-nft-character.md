# Claiming NFT Character

The Gen 1 batch of 10.000 limited-edition TINYs and FLEX were all claimed at launch.

You can purchase one listed for sale via **Key**. \
TINY are currently the third playable characters in the Knightiny Cross-Verse multiverse. \
Unlike land, of which there are only 20,000 per land ring, new generations of avatars can be released as needed. Once the second generation is minted, Gen 1 NFTs will be differentiated with props, boosts, and a few other special things that are TBA.&#x20;

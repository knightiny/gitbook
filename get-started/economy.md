# Economy

## For community&#x20;

The economy is entirely community-owned-and-governed. \
TINY token is the currency of the land ring, with each ring having an initial max supply of 1,000,000,000 TINY (which can be changed by a DAO vote if supply is excessively low due to burns). \
With each new cycle, as the ring economies are connected via trade routes, the total supply of TINY grows by that 1B (over time as it's minted). \
The more rings exist, the less of an inflationary effect this has relative to total supply due to burns.

## **A better economic system**

KNIGHTINY is a game and community built primarily for fun. As crypto degens and gamers, our goal is to use cryptocurrency to create something that gamers will really enjoy.

The game can replace your current cash flow, maybe for many, and at the very least reward you for contributing to the community and the game you enjoy. \
As you play and earn, you will have the option to burn the TINY token (thus reducing the supply). Basically, it's a way of simulating the real world where things cost money, but with this model there won't be inflation. \
\
The difference is that you don't pay corporations, you aim to reduce inflation, you pay into the community treasury, or you reward your fellow players. This is a people-centered economy, and we like to participate in it rather than lament the concentration of wealth and the exploitation of the modern world. Just by playing, you create something more.

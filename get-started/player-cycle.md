# Player Cycle

The path will repeat until you take control of the middle ground, which will give your faction discounts and resource boosts.

**Stage 1:** Mint NFT Character \
\
Take your TINY to mine resources that will bring you profit and improvements. \
\
As most of the TINY used to activate avatars in the game burns down, a major deflationary event occurs at this stage.\
\
**Stage 2:** Mint Land plots \
\
Landlords mint their 20,000 land plots in this stage and begin mining TINY tokens. \
Build Houses for generating more recourses, items and assets.

Each transaction will burn a portion of the sent token, which will not hurt the overall fee and keep the economy deflationary, so you don't overpay for an asset just because it's being traded a lot. \
\
Over time, players can declare themselves and apply for the DAO Consulate to make decisions, along with the developers and be part of the Senate.

The total supply of TINY is 1,000,000,000.\
\
**Stage 3:** Begin Play  \
\
Start playing as a fighter, landlord or both and get more resources by converting them into plasma for travel or token generation.\
\
**Stage 4:** Battle Pass\
\
Double the amount of resources you get or find NFT fragments with a battle pass that you can create at the Blacksmith House, find or purchase at the auction house.\
\
**Stage 5:** Championships\
\
Ð¡hampionships with the participation of willing teams, fighting for tokens, and additional temporary improvements in the game.
